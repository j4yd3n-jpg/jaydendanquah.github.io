                    <p>
                        Back in junior year of high school, I created a digital portfolio as part of a semester-long project. Since then, that site has obviously become outdated, and I lost editing access to it upon graduation.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        While it would've been easy to hit CTRL+U on my old site, transfer all the HTML and CSS over to this new one, and call it a day, I challenged myself to experiment with unique features, layouts, and the overall design. As the welcome screen says, this site is currently being worked on, so what you see now might be entirely different in the months that come.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        Hopefully, you'll come back every now and then to see what I'm up to. Thanks for visiting!
                    </p>
