                    Growing up, I've always been fascinated by the ways in which technology and creativity intersect one another. The first time I ever coded something was back in elementary school, when our computer readiness class participated in the nationwide Hour of Code initiative. The prospect of building an entire video game just by arranging colorful blocks of code on a blank canvas had me deeply enthralled, and the Hour of Code became an annual pleasure of mine with each school year that passed.

                    However, it wasn't until joining the advanced learners' program that I started to see coding not just as a pastime, but a career worthy of pursuing in the future. The advanced learners' curriculum introduced me to MIT's Scratch, which elevated the block-based interface from the Hour of Code with the new ability to create custom graphics, effects, and sounds in each program. To say I was blown away by the evolution would be putting it lightly, as my journey with Scratch ventured far beyond classroom instruction and homework assignments into weekends, holidays, and vacations. My projects spanned everything from visual art simulations to increasingly complex games which I shared with my friends. At one point, I even attempted to code a full-fledged web animation like other ambitious Scratch users had done in the past, though it ultimately never came to be.

                    Scratch made me believe that technology could be used to tell stories and be a pathway for creative visions to reach audiences everywhere and anywhere. Regrettably, I nearly lost sight of this powerful lesson as middle school came to an end and my vocational high school career began. The COVID-19 pandemic deprived me of many chances to flex my creative muscles in my chosen trade of programming and web development, and by the time in-person learning recommenced, my junior and senior years had me preoccupied with college readiness and other commitments that had me questioning whether I was pursuing the right field.
